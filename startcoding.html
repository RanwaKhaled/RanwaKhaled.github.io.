Students are able to get emerged into the deep learning of programming concepts throughout various activities and gain a foothold into engineering. A fun learning experience! Tutors help students use their capacities to their advantage via diverse team building activities, allowing children to recognize the multifaceted concepts of programming in accessible and entertaining ways.
            Information Technology has for a long time been considered a male-dominated field, and somewhat still is. Al Makinah tries to trigger impact and encourage a new generation of developers into computer programing as demands for software and web development competencies are on demand. Al Makinah founder, Eman El koshairy wants to challenge the social norms by pushing for gender diversity and creating a generations of female tech leaders.</p>

            <p class="restxt"> Girls Who Code is an international non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like and does. With their 7-week Summer Immersion Program, after school Clubs, College Loops program and New York Times best-selling series, they are leading the movement to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st-century opportunities. Girls Who Code has reached 300,000 girls around the world. 
            This was the first program I participated in after endless weeks of looking for a free program. And this website would not have been here without their self paced program. I will forever be grateful for this opportunity and this sense of sisterhood.

            <p class="restxt">
              TechGirls is an international summer exchange program designed to empower and inspire young women from the United States, Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa to pursue careers in science and technology.

             The centerpiece of the program is a weeklong technology camp that provides participants with an in-depth examination of technology-related topics, such as coding and cyber security and engages them in 45+ hours of hands-on instruction. The camp is complemented by additional activities such as site visits to technology companies, leadership clinics, community service opportunities, job shadowing, and cultural events. As part of program follow-on, the TechGirls implement at least one peer training program or service project within their schools and/or communities.

             This is a program of the U.S. Department of State, administered by Legacy International. 
             However, it’s a very competitive program and requires a little background about coding.
